            <h1 className="title-h1">Master NodeJS </h1>
            <p>Hello there! I have put together a course specifically for Zimbabwe on NodeJS and ReactJS, some of the most in demand Javascript frameworks. My course is intended to setup you up for success as a remote developer perhaps working for a US startup from home or maybe as a freelance developer working on Upwork. Postions like these guarantee you lucrative income and I am only speaking from experience - I'm the CTO of a US based startup! My goal is to teach you exactly what you need to succeed in the developer marketplace so a lot of what I am putting here comes from my experience as a CTO and tech lead. This means I'll be adding in essentials like versioning with Github, CI/CD pipleines, unit testing and mcuh more.</p>

            <h2>NodeJS Curriculm</h2>
            <p>We will learn how to build a custom backend from scratch using NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose as an ORM, GraphQL, MongoDB Cloud, Redis, Heroku, AWS, Git and Github.</p>
            <p>NodeJS is framework that allows you to run JavaScript on the server and is a popular backend solution. A backend is basically the brains behind most of the websites and apps you use everyday. Every mobile app you use and every website you interact with has some kind of backend that both processes the interactions you make with them and stores your data in a database. NodeJS is a very popular backend solution used by companies like Netflix, Uber, NASA and PayPal. We will also learn MongoDB which is a noSQL database and popular alternative to SQL type databases like PostgresSQL. noSQL especially finds itself suitable for rapid scaling, frequent evolution of data and high-traffic applications making it a preferred database for many startups. GraphQL is the talk of town in Silicon Valley. It is the alternative to REST APIs and you have to absolutely know it to succeed as a backend engineer. GraphQL was built by Facebook as a faster and more efficient way to interface a backend with numerous front end clients such as mobile apps and websites.</p>

            <h2>ReactJS Curriculum</h2>
            <p>We will learn how to build a custom front end website using ReactJS, Apollo, GraphQL, Redux, Hooks, Webpack, Babel, Git and Github.</p>
            <p>ReactJS is a Javascript library used to build user interfaces. ReactJS can be used to build websites and apps for both iOS and Android. We will be focusing on creating websites in this course. ReactJS is very popular and is used by Facebook, Netflix and DropBox. The website we will build will complement the NodeJS curriculm. This means we will be using what we use the NodeJS curriculum's backend for our ReactJS website. Therefore, if you do both the NodeJS and ReactJS course, you will effectively master both front end and backend engineering making you what we call a full stack developer.</p>

            <h2>Bonus: Typescript and NextJS (Pending)</h2>
            <p>Let me know if you would like to go even further beyond and take this course. This is bonus course for those of you looking for a real challenge and are prepared to do whatever it takes to stand out in the developer marketplace. Depending on the demand for this course I might just put it together.</p>
